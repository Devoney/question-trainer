General:
  ✔ Add i18n.
    I have chosen https://angular.io/guide/i18n over ngrx-translate as the idea is to have i18n from angular itself evolve where ngrx-translate is to be deprecated
    once i18n of ng covers everything that is need. And i18n contains more features if you do not necessarily need runtime changing of the language.

Unit testing:
  ✔ Resolve warnings in browser when running unit tests.
  ✔ Fix failing tests due to added store dependency.
  State:  
    ✔ Add book 
    ✔ Remove book
    ✔ Select books
    ✔ Select book count
  Components:
    book-add:
      ✔ Test book addition to store through ui.
    book-row:
      ✔ Test book removal from store through ui.

Refactor:
  ✔ // TODO: Fix this in a reactive way using observables
  ✔ Move responsibility of adding a book to book-add component to reduce bubbling up events.

Feature:
  ✔ Add confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion of a book.
  ☐ Be able to choose your language in the app.
  ☐ Add edit button for book title.
  ☐ Adds error message that book title already exists.

Git:
  ☐ Cleanup unused branches.
