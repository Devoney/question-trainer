General:
  ✔ Add i18n.
    I have chosen https://angular.io/guide/i18n over ngrx-translate as the idea is to have i18n from angular itself evolve where ngrx-translate is to be deprecated
    once i18n of ng covers everything that is need. And i18n contains more features if you do not necessarily need runtime changing of the language.
  ☐ Update i18n in book-add.

Unit testing:
  ✔ Resolve warnings in browser when running unit tests.
  ✔ Fix failing tests due to added store dependency.
  State:  
    ✔ Add book 
    ✔ Remove book
    ✔ Select books
    ✔ Select book count
  Components:
    book-add:
      ✔ Test book addition to store through ui.
      ☐ Test display of error message when title already exists
    book-row:
      ✔ Test book removal from store through ui.
      ☐ Test display of error message when title already exists from another book.

Refactor:
  ✔ // TODO: Fix this in a reactive way using observables
  ✔ Move responsibility of adding a book to book-add component to reduce bubbling up events.

Feature:
  ✔ Add confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletion of a book.
  ☐ Be able to choose your language in the app.
  ✔ Add edit button for book title.
  ✔ Display books on alphabet
  ✔ Block deleting books while in edit mode.
  ✔ Disable edit of book that is already being edited.
  ☐ Adds error message that book title already exists.
    ✔ While adding
    ☐ While editing.
