General:
  ✔ Use confirmation dialog as a service to the whole application, instead of having it in each table.
  Books:
    ✔ Refactoring getting questions of a book to the Book model itself.
    ✔ When a book is removed, its questions need to go out of the question list.
    ☐ Move logic for adding book into AddBook itself, out of BookManager to simply ping ponging of data.
  Chapters:
    ✔ Add-or-remove all questions in a chapter to/from the question list.
  State:
    ☐ Make getter types available.
    ☐ Move mutations in to modules based on models or components.
Testing:
    ☐ Spy on the store's commit method, instead of testing the state. To make the tests less fragile and more focussed.
      ✔ Index tests that should be refactored
