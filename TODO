General:
  ☐ @high Get rid of all the data methods, and use direct properties instead.
  ☐ Make properties public
  ☐ Check in newly created project with Vuex that the error _Uncaught TypeError: hook.flushStoreModules is not a function_ also occurs
  Books:
    ☐ Use store to validate book title, instead of event and property.
    ☐ Move logic for adding book into AddBook itself, out of BookManager to simply ping ponging of data.
    ☐ Use on hover title to show the error when title of book is invalid. (Thus remove error line below input).

Testing:
  ☐ Unit test store mutations explicitly also, instead of only through components.
