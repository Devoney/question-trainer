General:
  ☐ Use a Mixin for delete confirmation of Book and Chapter.
  Books:
    ☐ Commit edit of book title to store, instead of muting it directly on the book itself.
    ☐ Use store to validate book title, instead of event and property.
    ☐ Move logic for adding book into AddBook itself, out of BookManager to simply ping ponging of data.
    ☐ Use on hover title to show the error when title of book is invalid. (Thus remove error line below input).
  State:
    ☐ Make getter types available.
    ☐ Move mutations in to modules based on models or components.
