Online storage:
  Authentication:
    ☐ Add firebase console javascript snippet
    ☐ Use npm instead of html for firebaseui
      https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui

General:
  ☐ Remember tab page in the store
  ☐ Mobile first. Check that the page is shown nicely on portait mode and other resolutions.
  Books:
    ☐ Add all questions from all books
    ☐ Move logic for adding book into AddBook itself, out of BookManager to simply ping ponging of data.
  State:
    ☐ Store in state that the question is shown in question-trainer, instead of in question-trainer.
       This would also make unit testing easier because now either that text should be clicked,
       or a private member of question-trainer needs to be modified.
       Neither of this is nice.
    ☐ Make getter types available.
    ☐ Move mutations in to modules based on models or components.
Testing:
    ☐ Spy on the store's commit method, instead of testing the state. To make the tests less fragile and more focussed.
