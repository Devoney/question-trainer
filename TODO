General:
  ☐ Check in newly created project with Vuex that the error _Uncaught TypeError: hook.flushStoreModules is not a function_ also occurs
  Books:
    ☐ Use store to validate book title, instead of event and property.

Testing:
  ☐ Unit test store mutations explicitly also, instead of only through components.
