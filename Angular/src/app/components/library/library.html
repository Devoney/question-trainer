			<h4>What is this app?</h4>
			<p>
				An effective way to learn new things is by starting with a question, find the
				answer, and repeat that. So when you are studying from books for instance, you
				can turn everything you didn't know into questions. You then find the answer
				for it. When you repeat the questions till you know them, you are effectively
				studying. This app helps you doint that.
